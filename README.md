# Fake Map
This is a fa√ßade over `std::vector` that makes it act like `std::unordered_map`. This may seem like something very stupid to do, but it has some advantages over `std::unordered_map`:
* It takes significantly less memory
* It does not require the key type to have a hash function
* It preserves insertion order
* It can be faster (if indexed by `std::string`, it's faster if it contains less than about 200 elements)

## Linear complexity for access? What the hell?
Surprisingly, on GCC 9, it can be twice as fast as `std::unordered_map` with sizes around 30. If the size is large enough, the unfavourable complexity kicks in and the speed will start lagging after `std::unordered_map`. The breakpoint is around size 200. It is not as good on older compilers like MSVC 2015, where the breakpoint is only around 20.

Now, why is it so? My guess is that it has something to do with memory locality, less dynamic allocation, better vectorisation possibilities and maybe speculative execution.
